This transition improved data accuracy and efficiency, supported by customized reports that enhanced assessment transparency for students and staff. I utilized SIMS Assessment 7 module to create mark sheets for data collection and grade calculators for mock exams, significantly streamlining the assessment process.  Additionally, I developed a comprehensive system for calculating replacement grades during the COVID exam season, ensuring accurate and fair assessment outcomes. I played a crucial role in training staff on new data systems and methodologies, enabling them to leverage these tools effectively for student interventions. My work included transitioning data analysis tools from Datasec to SISRA, designing new school reports with detailed flight path graphs, and implementing FFT20 Benchmarks for KS4 target setting. I also managed a rolling transition between KS5 target setting systems, supported the new Exams officer, and developed a detailed data schedule to support strategic decision-making processes.
